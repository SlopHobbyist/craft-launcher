# Icon Processing

This directory contains icon assets and processing scripts.

## Usage

1. Drop your launcher icon into the `source/` directory:
   - `launcher-icon.png` - Icon for the launcher application (2048x2048)

2. The icon processing is automatically integrated into all build scripts

3. The script will automatically:
   - Resize the icon to required dimensions
   - Convert to platform-specific formats (.ico for Windows)
   - Place them in the correct build directories

## Requirements

- **Node.js** - Required (for running the build scripts)
- **ImageMagick** - Optional (for automatic icon processing)
  - macOS: `brew install imagemagick`
  - Windows: `choco install imagemagick`
  - Linux: `sudo apt-get install imagemagick`

If ImageMagick is not installed, the build will continue with existing icons.

## Generated Files

- `build/appicon.png` - Base launcher icon (512x512)
- `build/windows/icon.ico` - Windows launcher icon (multi-size: 16, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256)
- macOS .icns files are generated by Wails during build

## Game Icon

The game icon (Minecraft window) cannot be changed without modifying the game jar file, which would require a mod. The launcher icon works perfectly on all platforms.
