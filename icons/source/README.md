# Icon Source Files

Place your source icon file here:

## Required Files

### launcher-icon.png
- **Size:** 2048x2048 pixels
- **Format:** PNG with transparency
- **Purpose:** Icon for the Craft Launcher application
- **Used for:** macOS app icon, Windows .ico, taskbar icons

## Game Icon Note

The game icon (Minecraft window) cannot be changed through the launcher. It requires modifying the game jar file itself, which would need a mod. The launcher icon works on all platforms.

## Usage

1. Drop your 2048x2048 PNG files here
2. Run any build script:
   - `./build_all.sh` (macOS/Linux)
   - `build_all.bat` (Windows)
   - `./build_releases.sh` (macOS/Linux)
   - `build_releases.bat` (Windows)

The icons will be automatically processed and placed in the correct locations.

## Manual Processing

To process icons without building:
```bash
node ../process-icons.js
```

## Generated Outputs

From your source files, the script generates:
- `build/appicon.png` (512x512) - Base launcher icon for macOS
- `build/windows/icon.ico` - Multi-resolution Windows icon (16, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256)
- macOS .icns files are automatically generated by Wails during the build process

## Design Tips

- Start with a 2048x2048 canvas to ensure quality at all sizes
- Use simple, recognizable shapes that work at small sizes (16x16)
- Test how your icon looks at different sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
- Use transparency where appropriate
- Avoid fine details that won't be visible when scaled down
